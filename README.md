Blade UI kit with Bootstrap
===========================

**EXPERIMENTAL**

Use Bootstrap styles to [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/) components and more...

Currently the Bootstrap classes used are those of version 5.

Installation
------------

Require the project using Composer:

```
composer require forxer/blade-ui-kit-bootstrap
``

Since this package "extends" [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/), you need to publish the configuration file for it in order to change the prefix.
