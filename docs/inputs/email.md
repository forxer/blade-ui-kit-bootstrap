Email
=====

The most basic usage of the component is to simply reference it:

```blade
    <x-email name="email_address" />
```

This will output the following HTML:

```html
<input name="email_address" type="email" id="email_address" class="form-control">
```

*You can use this component in the same way as the "[Input](./docs/inputs/inputs.md#input)" component because it extends it.*
