Date
====

The most basic usage of the component is to simply reference it with a `name` attribute:

```blade
<x-date name="someday" />
```

This will output the following HTML:

```html
<input name="someday" type="date" id="someday" class="form-control">
```

*You can use this component in the same way as the "[Input](./docs/inputs/inputs.md#input)" component because it extends it.*
